LOS ANGELES — Matthew Perry died Saturday of an apparent drowning at his Pacific Palisades home, a representative for the actor and a law enforcement source say.

Perry was 54.

A 911 call came in at 4:07 p.m. local time and was treated as a water rescue, according to a law enforcement source.

There was no indication of foul play and no confirmed cause of death, the source said. An investigation is ongoing.

Los Angeles Fire Department spokesperson Brian Humphrey said first responders went to a home in Pacific Palisades based on a 911 call at 4:07 p.m. about a "water emergency" of an unknown type.

No one was taken to a hospital, he said, and Los Angeles police officers from the West L.A. Division were on scene.

More details about Perry's death were not immediately available Saturday night.

Perry was best known for his role as one of the core cast members on "Friends," NBC's Generation X sitcom from the '90s.

About a year ago Perry was on a press tour for the release of his memoir, "Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir," which added to revelations about his battle with addiction, including a near-death experience in 2019 after his colon burst as a result of his use of opioids.

On "Friends," he played Chandler Bing, a statistical analyst who used sarcasm and one-liners.

The show was a blockbuster for television, dominating prime time alongside "Seinfeld." It ran for 10 seasons, from 1994 to 2004.

Perry also appeared in several other hits, including "Boys Will Be Boys," "Growing Pains," Beverly Hills, 90210," "The West Wing" and "Scrubs."

He was raised in Ottawa, Canada.

Perry had a successful run as a top-ranked tennis player competing in Canadian juniors, but he essentially left the sport to pursue acting when he moved to L.A. at age 15.

He joined the cast of "Friends" at age 24.
