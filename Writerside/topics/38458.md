The S&P 500 tried to climb out of correction territory Monday as traders braced for a big week filled with a Federal Reserve rate decision, jobs report and Apple's earnings report.

The [broader index](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) advanced 0.9%, while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.IXIC/) jumped 0.8%. The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.DJI/) gained 436 points, or 1.3%.

Communication services stocks outperformed, with the S&P 500 sector last up by 2%. [Mega-cap tech stock stocks](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html#107325415-Nf0SbmoVI) [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/) and [Meta Platforms](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/) were up by about 2%, each.

Those moves come after the S&P 500 fell into correction territory last week. The broader index shed 2.5% for the week to put it down by more than 10% from its 2023 closing high. It's off 3.2% for October, on pace for its third-straight negative month which would be its first such streak since 2020 as the pandemic struck.

S&P 500 YTD

The Treasury Department on Monday is [set to issue its quarterly financing estimates and economic statement](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/29/stock-market-today-live-updates.html#107325546-cnL8jslDh), which outlines the government's borrowing needs for the next three quarters. In July, the last time the Treasury released its statement, the amount of borrowing surprised markets. Investors are hoping expectations are more fully priced in this time around.

The Federal Reserve decision looms Wednesday, when the central bank is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate at the same level. With surging interest rates as the main culprit of this stock market correction, investors will be hoping the Fed signals it could be done raising rates. Traders expect the Fed to be done raising rates at least for 2023.

"Whilst we have a Fed meeting, the consensus has never been clearer that they're not going to do anything at this particular meeting, and that'll be back to back meetings of them not raising rates," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. "I think that may signal that the cycle of raising rates is over, and I think that that likely helps to sort of stop that parabolic rise we've seen in Treasury yields."

"I think if we see rates plateauing here for a bit that would certainly usher in some good news," Hogan added.

The 10-year Treasury yield jumped above 5% to start last week, but [it traded around 4.89% on Monday.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/30/us-treasurys-investors-look-to-fed-meeting-key-data-due-this-week.html) Friday will bring the October jobs report with investors hoping for some slowing in the labor market that will allow the Fed to feel comfortable with staying on hold the rest of the year.

Apple will report earnings Thursday after the bell. The S&P 500's largest member is in a correction itself, down 15% from its 52-week high.

S&P 500 oversold bounce may not last long, chart analyst says
-------------------------------------------------------------

The S&P 500 is off to a solid start Monday after entering oversold territory last week. To be sure, Frank Cappelleri of CappThesis noted similar rebound attempts earlier in the year weren't longlasting.

Specifically Cappelleri noted that a rebound attempt off the August lows "faded aggressively."

"Potential bullish patterns were thwarted, and new lows eventually resulted – all of which the SPX has to avoid repeating for any rally to prove meaningful – whether that starts now or at some other time in the near future," he said.

Treasury quarterly financing news due this afternoon
----------------------------------------------------

Markets will be watching closely Monday when the Treasury Department issues its quarterly financing estimates and economic statement at 3 p.m. ET.

The announcement will detail the government's borrowing needs for the next three quarters and how it sees financing conditions unfolding.

Last time the Treasury released its statement, in late July, markets were surprised by how much borrowing the government would need, and yields popped soon after to their highest levels in 16 years. Markets are hoping that expectations are more evenly calibrated this time around.

On Wednesday, the Treasury will release its refunding statement, which will set auction levels and dates.

Megacap technology could lift S&P 500 into year end, says Fundstrat's Lee
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Despite the recent pullback in technology names, Fundstrat's Tom Lee is bracing for the elite group of stocks to potentially lead the S&P 500 higher into the end of 2023.

"The mood of investors has turned somewhat cautious, so they faded decent earnings," he told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Monday. "I don't think FAANG fundamentals are weaker — they're still at the center of this AI, secular story."

Many major megacap technology stocks sold off last week despite mostly solid earnings, with Alphabet posting its worst week on record since March 2020.

ON Semiconductor is the biggest laggard in the S&P 500

[ON Semiconductor](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ON/) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 during midday trading. It last tumbled more than 18% after the semiconductor supplier company issued weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter guidance.

Otherwise, the semiconductor name topped third-quarter earnings and revenue expectations.

The likelihood of a fourth-quarter rally has "fallen considerably" over the past month, according to Morgan Stanley chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson.

Word Bank says Middle East conflict could spark 'dual shock' to commodity markets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although the impact of the Israel-Hamas war on oil prices has been more limited than expected so far, the World Bank says an escalation of the conflict could push global commodity markets into "uncharted waters."

The World Bank's Commodity Markets Outlook offered three scenario forecasts for oil supplies and prices. Under the Bank's baseline forecast, it sees oil prices to average $90 a barrel in the current quarter and falling to $81 a barrel in 2024 as global economic growth slows.

If the conflict were to escalate, however, it sees prices gaining ground. In the case of a "small disruption scenario, the Bank estimates oil prices could rise to a range of $93 to $102 a barrel. In a "medium disruption scenario," which it says is roughly equivalent to the Iraq war in 2003, oil prices could climb up to a range of $109 and $121. A "large disruption" scenario, comparable to the Arab oil embargo in 1973, would drive up prices to between $140 and $157 a barrel, the World Bank said.

"The latest conflict in the Middle East comes on the heels of the biggest shock to commodity markets since the 1970s—Russia's war with Ukraine," said Indermit Gill, the World Bank's Chief Economist and Senior Vice President for Development Economics. "If the conflict were to escalate, the global economy would face a dual energy shock for the first time in decades—not just from the war in Ukraine but also from the Middle East."

Bank of Japan to consider allowing yields to rise above 1%, report says
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bank of Japan officials on Tuesday are expected to consider allowing longer-term bond yields to rise above a 1% cap amid a run-up in rates the central bank is trying to stave off, according to a report Monday.

Rising U.S. bond yields have spread globally and are pressuring their global counterparts, particularly since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently emphasized his commitment to fighting inflation. Allowing flexibility on previous yield curve caps could provide BoJ officials some breathing room, [NikkeiAsia reported,](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Bank-of-Japan/BOJ-to-tweak-policy-again-to-allow-10-year-yields-to-exceed-1) citing sources familiar with the talks.

Rising U.S. bond rates have resulted in money flowing to the dollar, putting downward pressure on the yen and exacerbating inflation. Allowing some flexibility on the caps chases away speculators while helping Japan manage its own inflation issue.

The yen rose against the U.S. dollar following the Nikkei report, most recently trading at 149.21.
