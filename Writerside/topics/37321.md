WireHole is a combination of WireGuard, PiHole, and Unbound in a docker-compose project that enables users to quickly create a personally managed WireGuard VPN with ad blocking capabilities and DNS caching. The project supports multiple architectures and provides a user-friendly web panel for managing the VPN. Users can add clients configurations and modify the upstream DNS provider for Unbound.
