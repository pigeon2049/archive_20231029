Staunch U.S. ally Jordan asked Washington to deploy Patriot air defence systems to bolster its border defence at a time of heightened regional tensions and conflict, the spokesperson for the country's army said on Sunday.

"We asked the American side to help bolster our defence system with Patriot air defence missile systems," Brigadier General Mustafa Hiyari, Jordan's army spokesperson, told state television.
