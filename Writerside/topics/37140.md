Saudi Arabian Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman is expected to visit Washington on Monday for meetings with senior Biden administration officials, Axios reported on Saturday, citing three sources with knowledge of the trip.

The visit had been long-scheduled, the sources told Axios, but it would come as Israel on Saturday [unleashed the second phase of the Gaza war](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-presses-ground-campaign-against-hamas-second-stage-gaza-war-2023-10-28/) as its forces pressed ground operations against Hamas militants, vowing to "destroy the enemy above ground and below ground."

Khalid bin Salman is expected to meet with White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and several senators, according to the Axios report.

The White House National Security Council told Reuters it had nothing to confirm when asked about the possible visit.
