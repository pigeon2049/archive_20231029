Actor Matthew Perry, who gained fame in the 1990s for his starring role in the hit U.S. television comedy "Friends," was found dead at age 54 on Saturday in a hot tub at a Los Angeles-area home, the Los Angeles Times and TMZ.com reported.

Both news outlets cited unnamed law enforcement sources for their reports, which Reuters could not immediately confirm independently.
