Actor Matthew Perry, best known for playing Chandler Bing on the hit TV show _Friends_, has died, according to multiple media outlets. He was 54 years old.

Perry was found dead of an apparent drowning at his Los Angeles home on Saturday, according to the [_Los Angeles Times_](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-28/freinds-star-matthew-perry-dead-at-56)_,_ [celebrity outlet TMZ](https://www.tmz.com/2023/10/28/friends-star-matthew-perry-dead-dies-drowning/) and other reports.

Perry was cast in _Friends_, the sitcom that shot him to fame, at age 24. He starred as Chandler for the sitcom's entire 10-season run, a sarcastic yet affable commitment-phobe who later found love with the Type-A Monica Geller (Courteney Cox).

"I loved Chandler, I loved the show, and I also knew: Remember this, because it's going to be the best time of your life," Perry said in an [ABC News _Nightline_ interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57GYwj6YcnU) with Diane Sawyer last year.

But behind the scenes, Perry struggled with addiction. He opened up about his decades-long excessive use of alcohol and pills in his memoir published last year, _Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing_. In the book, which he dedicated to fellow sufferers of addiction, he detailed his painful struggle with drug use and his related health problems: He said he'd spent half of his life in treatment, detoxed an estimated 65 times and underwent 14 surgeries.

"Whenever I bumped into something that I didn't really want to share, I would think of the people that I would be helping, and it would keep me going," the actor [told _The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/23/arts/television/matthew-perry-friends-lovers-and-the-big-terrible-thing.html) last year.

While on set, Perry said he tried to keep his addiction hidden and described his unhealthy relationship with his work.

"I felt like I was gonna die if the live audience didn't laugh, and that's not healthy for sure," Perry [wrote in the memoir](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250866448/friendsloversandthebigterriblething). "But I could sometimes say a line and the audience wouldn't laugh and I would sweat and sometimes go into convulsions. If I didn't get the laugh I was supposed to get I would freak out. I felt that every single night. This pressure left me in a bad place. I also knew of the six people making that show, only one of them was sick."

Friend and co-star Lisa Kudrow was quoted in the _Nightline_ episode as saying, "Matthew Perry was always the one trying to keep everyone else happy."

Perry received an Emmy nomination for his _Friends_ role and two more for his dramatic turn as associate White House counsel on _The West Wing_.

Perry also starred in several films, including _Fools Rush In, The Whole Nine Yards_, _17 Again_ and the TV show _Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip._

Born in Massachusetts, the actor was raised in various parts of Canada, often traveling between the homes of his split parents in Los Angeles and Montreal. In Canada, he became a nationally ranked junior tennis player.

Later in life, the actor moved on to pickleball, the _Times_ reported, even getting a court built at his new home in the Pacific Palisades.
