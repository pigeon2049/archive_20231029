Zoom optimized its app for large screens on Android, aiming to provide a seamless user experience for tablet users. The app's UI was optimized using the Jetpack WindowManager library, ConstraintLayouts, and resizable emulators in Android Studios. The optimization allowed users to have a hands-free experience, improved multitasking capabilities, and the app's UI scaled accordingly when users resized their windows.
